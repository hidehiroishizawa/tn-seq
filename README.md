This repository contains imtermediate data and analytical codes for the genome-wide transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) experiment, which aimed to identify Aquitalea magnusonii H3 genes involved in the colonization and proliferation on duckweed (Lemna minor). The detailed descriptions on experimental procedure will be published from the same authors. The raw sequence data are available in DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under accession number DRA011959.
