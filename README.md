This repository contains imtermediate data and analytical codes for the genome-wide transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) experiment, using a plant growth-promoting bacterium (Aquitalea magnusonii H3) and its host plant (Lemna minor). The detailed descriptions on experimental design will be published from the same authors. The raw sequence data are available in DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under accession number DRA011959.
