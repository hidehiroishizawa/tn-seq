tnseq_data_and_codes
This dataset reports the imtermediate data and analytical procedure for the genome-wide transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) experiment, which aimed to identify Aquitalea magnusonii H3 genes contribute to colonizatoin and fitness on the floating macrophyte, duckweed (L. minor). The detailed descriptions about experimental procedure (e.g., how the samples were collected and sequenced) will be published from the same authors. The raw sequence data are available in DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under accession number DRA011959.
