# Data and analytical code for: Ishizawa et al. Genome-wide identification of bacterial colonization- and fitness-related genes on the aquatic plant, duckweed
This dataset reports the imtermediate data and analytical procedure for the genome-wide transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) experiment, which aimed to identify Aquitalea magnusonii H3 genes contribute to colonizatoin and fitness on the floating macrophyte, duckweed (L. minor). The detailed descriptions about experimental procedure (e.g., how the samples were collected and sequenced) will be published in the paper from the same authors. The raw sequence data are available in DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under accession number DRA011959.
